# Cinephilia Database Desktop Application
 I have always been a movie geek so I decided to create a database desktop application for the people that share the same passion towards cinema. Cinephilia enables directors , movie stars and public audience to access a huge database of movies with unique functionalities for each user. Using data science every user will have a wide variety of statistics offered to help him relative to his account type. It might seem that that the application is just a desktop version of IMBD but it is not, it offers the users a new class of functionalities that transform random data to elegant informative one. If you are a cinema lover go check the repo in the link below and enjoy the wonderful experience of having informative data at the tips of your fingers. Technologies : C# ,MS SQL server, .NET packages used : GUNA , LVcharts
